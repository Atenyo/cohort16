    <h2>Software Engineer 004</h2>
    <p>During my two week journey study of Software Engineer 004, i was abit intimidated wondering if am at the end i
        will be able to learn.
        But given the coaching session we had, i got more excited to learn more on how to build a wedsite.
        I started with basics of learning how to the internet works and also its history. Then we looked at Version
        Control that is how you can make changes to a document when given access to.
        We proceed to understand how Git is used while using HTML and CSS. Later, we looked more into how to use
        Bootstrap 5 to build a website.
        This is where it got more exciting because we learnt that there are website out there that simplifies work of
        people who are coding thus that's where bootstap comes in.
        Through my experience, i gained not only technical skills but also a deeper understanding of importance of
        design, user experience, and funtionality.
        I realised that building a website is not just about writing code, but about creating a platform that provides
        value to users.
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership and Personal Development</h2>
    <p>We focused on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective people. I also learnt that by living these 7 Habits that your
        entire paradigm changes.
        Atleast one should be also follow one of the 7 habits for their life to changed to successful one. Through the
        course i noticed that ones' behaviour affect ones' life.
        Through my experience i gained alot of understanding of an effective lifestyle should be that is personal and
        also work places.
        I learnt how to handle different emotional states while studying for the course and we became more interactive
        during the process.
        The exciting part was when we were put into various groups, these encouraged us to interact more with our
        classmates.
        Because everytime a breaking room was created, you were put with different people from the previous time. During
        the various exercises created we were able to
        create our mission statements clearly that is well defined. We also looked at each of the 7 habits respectfully
        and defined them well.
