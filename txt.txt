            In this, we basically studied the 7 Habits of an highly effectiveperson. During the study, we also learnt how to apply those seven habits into our daily lives. Thus changing our paradigm into a more effective one.
             We also understood the common paradigm we normally face in our daily life deeply. Then looked at how you can turn those common paradigm into a highly effective one.
            Later, created our mission statement that is our long life goaols and see through on how to achieve them
            as we age. Practice the daily habits in our daily life.


          In the course unit we study how to create a website.Here we study how the internet works and
          it's history. We learn about how to use Vs code, Git, HTML, CSS and lastly
          Bootstrap.We go deeper into understanding them.Throughout our learning you get hand on experience
          that you get engaged in coding. My experience was abit challenging but also interesting since you get more
          curious as the course goes. During those challenges you are even more curios to learn about what happens next
          or how to solve your issue so as it can be a proper website.
